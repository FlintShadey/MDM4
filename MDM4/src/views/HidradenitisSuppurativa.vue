The risks, benefits, and potential complications (bleeding, infection, recurrence, scarring) were explained to the patient.\n\nThe area was prepped with a Betadine solution and draped in a sterile manner. Local infiltration with 1% lidocaine with epinephrine was administered around the area of fluctuance. The patient tolerated the local anesthetic injections without complication.\n\nA small, linear incision was made over the most fluctuant or pointing area using a No. 11 blade scalpel.\n\nThick, purulent material was expressed. The cavity was gently probed and broken up to ensure complete evacuation of loculations. The abscess cavity was copiously irrigated with normal saline to remove any debris or residual purulent material.\n\nA small ribbon of gauze was packed into the wound to allow continued drainage.\n\nMinimal bleeding was noted and controlled with direct pressure.\n\nEstimated blood loss was minimal.\n\nThe area was dressed with a non-adherent dressing.\n\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no immediate complications.\n\nNo neurovascular compromise was noted, and no damage to surrounding tissues was observed.\n\nThe patient was instructed on proper wound care and follow-up instructions.",
